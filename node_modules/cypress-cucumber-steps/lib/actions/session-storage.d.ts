/**
 * When I clear session storage:
 *
 * ```gherkin
 * When I clear session storage
 * ```
 *
 * Clear [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) data for all origins with which the test has interacted.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * Clear all sessionStorage:
 *
 * ```gherkin
 * When I clear session storage
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 *
 * Cypress automatically clears all session storage _before_ each test to prevent state from being shared across tests when [test isolation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Isolation) is enabled. You shouldn't need to use this command unless you're using it to clear sessionStorage inside a single test or test isolation is disabled.
