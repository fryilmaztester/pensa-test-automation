/**
 * When I find element by title:
 *
 * ```gherkin
 * When I find element by title {string}
 * ```
 *
 * Finds the first element that has a matching `title` attribute. This will also find a `title` element within an SVG.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```gherkin
 * When I find element by title "Close"
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * This precedes steps like {@link When_I_click | "When I click"}. For example:
 *
 * ```gherkin
 * When I find element by title "Close"
 *   And I click
 * ```
 *
 * Inspired by Testing Library's [ByTitle](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/bytitle).
